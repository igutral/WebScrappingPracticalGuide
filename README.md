# Web scraping - practical guide
Sample code created for presentation called "Web scraping - practical guide"

# Notes and disclaimers
Please note that:
* Demo contains various method that can be used to scrap the website including:
    * PowerBI Desktop Native + R + Python
    * Python (BeautifulSoup, PyPeater, Selenium)
    * .NET Core + .NET framework
* The main demo contains the full working example of parsing one of the most popular website that is describing poslish celebrities life using Python
* Demos written in .NET should be treated as an example only and they were not tested fully as well as some methods were not implemented
* The PowerBI desktop file that contains the report contains only the very small subset of the data
* The Python code works and was able to parse the above site till 2019-05-15, but it might stop working if the page structure will be changed
* For Python example there is a DockerFile and the code can be easily run using Docker
* If you want to run any code please make sure that you have configured the connection string properly (ip address, user id, user pass)
* **I do not recommend and I am not suggesting to use that script to parse above or any other website extensively**
